## Competition 1: BCIT Engineering Competition 2024

**Description:** Participated in the BCIT Engineering Competition (Junior Design), where the goal was to design and build a device to rescue a person ("Fed") from a high-rise building within 2 hours and 45 minutes. The project combined elements of industrial crane mechanisms and delta robot configurations for precision and efficiency.

**Key Features & Technologies:**
- **Delta Robot Gripper:** Designed a 2D delta robot-inspired gripper using drinking straws for flexibility and lightweight motion.
- **Creative Material Usage:** Used paper clips as joints and reinforced long wooden dowels with cardboard and glue to construct sturdy links.
- **Base Design:** Utilized a cardboard box as the base to provide stability and save time during assembly.
- **Cost Efficiency:** Successfully completed the project with a budget of 90 BEC Bucks out of the allocated 250.
- **Fast Build:** Completed brainstorming, construction, and testing under the competition's tight time constraints.
