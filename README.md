## Project 1: 3D Printed RC Car
**Description:** Designed and 3D-printed an RC car modeled after a real-sized automobile. The project aimed to replicate the design and function of a modern vehicle in a scaled-down version.

**Key Features & Technologies:**
- **3D Modeling:** Utilized SolidWorks to create a detailed 3D model of the car’s chassis and parts.
- **Embedded Systems:** Developed the RC system using an Arduino microcontroller to control the car's motors and steering.
- **Motion Control:** Implemented PID controllers for smooth steering and speed regulation.
- **3D Printing & Assembly:** Printed the components and successfully assembled them to create a functional prototype.

## Project 2: Sticker Identification for Kid's Game in Nesters Market
**Description:** Developed a computer vision system to identify and differentiate stickers for a kid’s game as part of a project for Nesters Market. The goal was to enable a robotic or automated system to recognize stickers and trigger corresponding game actions.

**Key Features & Technologies:**
- **Computer Vision:** Created image processing algorithms using OpenCV in Python to detect and classify stickers based on shape, color, and pattern.
- **Machine Learning:** Trained a lightweight machine learning model to improve identification accuracy.
- **Real-World Testing:** Deployed the system in a controlled environment at Nesters Market for live testing with children.

## Project 3: Humanoid Robot Modeled and Trained in Simulation (In Progress)
**Description:** Currently working on designing and simulating a humanoid robot based on the Bruce robot from WESTWOOD Robotics. The project involves replicating the humanoid design and training the robot in a virtual simulation environment.

**Key Features & Technologies:**
- **3D Modeling & Simulation:** Using Blender and ROS/Gazebo to model and simulate the robot’s design and functionalities.
- **Motion Planning & Control:** Working on implementing algorithms for dynamic motion control and balance.
- **Reinforcement Learning:** Training the robot to perform basic movements and tasks using reinforcement learning algorithms.
- **Design Inspiration:** The robot’s design and capabilities are inspired by the Bruce robot from WESTWOOD Robotics.
